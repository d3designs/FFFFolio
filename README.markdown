# FFFFolio

Fantastic no-Frills Flickr Folio

A simple and elegant way to host your own Flickr powered portfolio, designed and developed by [Jay Williams](http://myd3.com/).
FFFolio can help you setup an online portfolio that is minimalist, easy to update, and entirely powered by Flickr Collections & Sets.

Initial installation does require some knowledge of HTML, PHP, and Flickr. After installation, everything is updated via Flickr & and the Flickr Organizer.

## Requirements

* [Flickr API Key](http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply)
* PHP 5.2
	* cURL
	* JSON
	* SimpleXML

## Download

You can download the source code in a [ZIP Archive](http://github.com/d3designs/FFFFolio/zipball/master), or clone the project using Git:

	git clone git@github.com:d3designs/FFFFolio.git
	cd FFFFolio

## Setup

Rename the config file, located in the app directory, from `config-sample.inc.php` to `config.inc.php` and add your Flickr API key/secret, as well as the User and Collection ID.

The `app/cache/` directory must be writable by the web server. A folder permission of 755 or 777 should be sufficient.

By default, all Flickr API calls are cached for 6 hours, this can be changed in the FFFFolio Class if necessary.
